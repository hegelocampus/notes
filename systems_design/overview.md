# Overview
- Coding interviews focus on problem solving ability. This includes some knowledge of data-structures, but you can almost always design a working algorithm without this knowledge, it will just probably won't be an optimized solution.
- System design is completely different from this because it requires knowledge of the fundamentals to be able to tackle a systems design problem.
## What are Design Fundamentals?
- Design questions are often intentionally vague. **Part of the problem is knowing which questions you need to ask to design the system, e.g., what you need to optimize for.**
- A particular solution will almost never be objectively correct. Part of the solution must be justifying the particular solution you've chosen. You must be able to defend and adapt your solution based on what the interviewer is saying.
- Four broad categories of design fundamentals:
  - Underlying or foundational knowledge - If you don't understand these you will at best have gaps in your ability to defend your solution, and at work be unable to build a solution at all.
  - Key characteristics of systems
	- Availability
	- Redundancy
	- Latency
  - Actual component - The more tangible pieces of the system. These actually allow the system to have its key components.
  - Actual tech - The actual parts you can use in your system to fill a particular role in your system, e.g., Zookeeper, Nginx, AWS, Google Cloud Service.
