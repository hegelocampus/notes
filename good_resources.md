# Resources I like
## Learn to learn
[Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/): This is honestly the most important thing related to being a software engineer I think I've ever read. The best way to be a great software engineer is to streamline how you learn.
## All languages are getting stricter as programs become more complex, strict types are the future
[Learn Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)
[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
## If you want to get good at Linux
[Install Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
Even if you don't use Arch, the [Arch Wiki is the best source of Linux Knowledge](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)
Buy a couple Raspberry Pi's and [setup a server cluster](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/a1k0vd/what_do_you_use_raspberry_pi_clusters_for/). It honestly probably won't be _tangibly_ good for much, but its a great way to learn how servers work and get good and network stuff.
Build [Linux from scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/). This is hard mode but if you do this you will know more about Linux than pretty much any CS graduate.
