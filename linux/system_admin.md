# System Admin
## Essential Duties of a System Administrator
Not every system administrator will need to know how to do all these things, but it's good to have a general understanding of how they all work together.
### Controlling access
- Create accounts for new users, removes accounts of inactive users, and handle all related issues such as lost passwords and lost key pairs.
- This process is typically automated by a configuration management system or directory service.
### Adding hardware
- Admins who work with physical hardware must actually install and configure it.
- Chores range from adding a network interfere to configing a specialized external storage array
### Automating tasks
- Repetitive tasks or time consuming tasks should be automated away.
- Automating tasks not only saves time but it also avoids human error and increases response time.
### Overseeing backups
- Backing up is annoying and time consuming but **incredibly important**.
- There are a lot of great tools to automate this.
### Installing and upgrading software
- Upgrade for **security patches**
- You've got to figure out the best way to make sure everyone's software is up to date.
### Monitoring
- Users likely will try to work around a problem rather than actually document it so you've got to have systems in place to log issues.
### Troubleshooting
- Things fail and you've got to be able to fix them.
- Finding the source of a problem is often more challenging than resolving it.
### Maintaining local documentation
- You need documentation in order to communicate with your team how the system works and how to use it.
- Documentation also needs to be in a usable format. A network diagram is more useful than a dense man page describing a design.
### Vigilantly monitoring security
- Admins are the first line of defense for protecting network-attached systems.
- Must implement a security policy and set up procedures to prevent systems from being breached.
### Tuning performance
- UNIX and Linux are general purpose operating systems. A good admin can tailor systems to suit their technical needs.
### Developing site policies
- Most sites need policies that govern the acceptable use of computer systems, the management and retention of data, the privacy and security of networks and systems, and other areas of regulatory interest.
### Working with vendors
- Most sites rely on third parties to provide a variety of ancillary services and products.
- Admins may be tasked with selecting vendors, assisting with contract negotiations, and implementing solutions.
### Fire fighting
- Day to day problem solving of individuals problems related to the system, from builds not working to spilled water.
