# TCP/IP Networking
- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** is the networking system that underlies the Internet. TCP/IP does not depend on any particular hardware or operating system, so devices that speak TCP/IP can all exchange data despite their many differences.
- TCP/IP works on networks of any size or topology, even when they are not connected to the outside world.
