# System Calls
- The Linux kernel has a robust codebase that is able to perform many actions:
  - Read from a HDD
  - Make network connections
  - Create and kill processes
  - Change file permissions
  - Accept/read input from keyboards
- The programs don't know how to do those actions, so they ask the kernel to do those tasks for them using **system calls**.
  - During system calls the Linux kernel takes over, performs the needed task, and then returns the result to the program.
- Every system call has a number, for example chmod is #90 on `x86_64`
- You can see which system calls a program is using with `strace`
- `strace ls /tm` will show you every system call `ls` uses. (Note you shouldn't use strace on a production database because it has high overhead.
