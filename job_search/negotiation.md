## Negotiation
### How much money do you want to make?
- **Do not use the word negotiate**
- Have a well researched number to give them if you need to
- What is the number that you need? (Be very honest)
- Add a kiss-up phrase at the end of everything here
#### Phone screen
- Right now it might be a little early to discuss this. I'm currently more focused on making sure the culture and team are a great fit. When the time is right I'll look into Glassdoor and the local job market and I'm sure we can find something that's a win-win for both of us.
#### On-site
- I'm use you'll offer me something fair and competitive in the marketplace.
#### If they demand a number
- For me its really about culture and fit. But based on Glassdoor, the local market, and my experience I would like something in the 100k range. But I'm sure that we can find something that will be a win-win for both of us.
### If they make an verbal offer (which they probably will)
- Say you're really excited and that you look forward to thinking over the offer with your family
- Ask for time to think about it
  - Hopefully I can get back to you in about a week or so
- Message Eli
- Email all jobs you've applied at saying that you've gotten an offer and that they are your top choice and were hoping they can expedite the process
