## Personal Pitch notes
### Your triangle
- Why are you doing programming
  - Start with "I'm a software engineer"
	- Frame yourself as a software engineer
  - Good answers are problem solving, being able to build things from scratch, artistic expression
- What are your skills/languages/frameworks
  - Do research on what they are looking for and the frameworks they use
- Argue for why you would be a valuable asset to that company
  - Be specific and try to synthesize your skills/values with what you know about the company
  - Passion is often hired over skill
#### Notes on personal pitch
- If you aren't given an opportunity to explicitly say your personal pitch, force it in at some point where it would make sense
