# Notes on Pragmatic Thinking and Learning
### 20-01-01
## Introduction
- Everything is connected to everything else
  - Always consider the context of what you're dealing with
## Dreyfus Model stages
### Novice
- Don't attempt to learn
- Only concerned with succeeding
- Need a recipe to follow and don't know what to do if they need to improvise
### Advanced Beginners
- Most people never leave this stage
- Don't want the big picture
- Tend to skim documentation for the meaty bits
### Competent
- Develop conceptual models of the problem domain and work with those models effectively
- Can troubleshoot on their own
- Begin to seek out and apply advice from experts
- Solve problems based on deliberate planning and past experience
  - Still have trouble determining what details to focus on
### Proficient
- Need the big picture
- Major breakthrough in being able to correct previous poor task performance
- Reflect on how they did something and revise their approach
- Can learn from others mistakes to make your approach better
- Acquired ability to **understand and apply _maxims_**
  - These are proverbial fundamental truths that can be applied to the situation at hand
- Understanding context is key to becoming an expert
### Expert
- Work from _intuition_ rather than reason
- Knows the difference between irrelevant details and the very important details, even if not at a conscious level
### Moving from Novice to expert
- The three most important changes that are made are:
  - Moving away from reliance on rules to use of intuition
  - A change in perception where you take into account context in order to focus on the relevant bits
  - A change from being a detached observer to an involved part of the system
	- You are part of the problem and you are part of the solution
### Phases of learning:
- Imitate
  - Do as others do
  - Copy the techniques as they are taught, without modification
- Assimilate
  - Reflect on the meaning and purpose of the techniques to come to a deeper understanding of them
  - Incorporate these newly learned patterns into your tool-kit
- Innovate
  - Build new patterns/techniques yourself
### Keep practicing / Beware the Tool Trap
- A model is a tool, not a mirror
  - It shouldn't produce the exact same outcome every time you should look at how the tool fits into the context of the situation and adapt
- Rules cannot tell you the most relevant activities to perform in a given situation or the correct path to take
- **Avoid formal methods if you need creativity, intuition, or inventiveness**
  - There is no substitute for thinking
### Consider the Context, Again
- Formal knowledge is often devoid of the **truth** of context
- It is often the relationship between things that are interesting, not the things themselves. These relationships help form the context that makes all the difference.

**The most important skill to learn is the skill of learning**

#### Rate yourself with the Dreyfus model
##### JavaScript
- Competent
  - I think at this stage I'm really focused on just applying the methodologies that have previously succeeded for me in the past, I don't really take in a holistic account of the problem before I start to tackle it. It may help me to slow down a little and consider the context more before jumping in.
##### React
- Between Competent and Proficient
  - I like to have the big picture before I really dive into a problem, but I think I need more experience solving problems different ways before I can truly react the proficient level.
  - I believe I'm proficient in so far as I'm able to correct past mistakes that I've made when building React apps and I think I'm able to learn from others' mistakes now
  - I know I'm able to reflect on how I did something and learn to better my approach now with each try
## This Is Your Brain
### L-mode
  - synchronous
  - logical
### R-mode
  - asynchronous
  - searches through memories
  - intuition
  - Unpredictable at best
  - Be ready to capture any insight or idea twenty-four hours a day
	- Get a pen and notepad
  - nonverbal
  - Favors learning by synthesis
	- Puts together parts to form wholes
  - Likes to think of things in relation to other ideas
  - Expert level knowledge is all R-mode
	- Intuition
	- Tacit knowledge
	- Pattern recognition
**Learn by synthesis as well as by analysis**
### Attractive works better
- Contemporary life is a battle of aesthetics
- _Attractive_ user interfaces are easier to use than _unattractive_ ones
> Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love. - Louis Kahn
- You can only improve if you believe you can
### Next actions
- Make a conscious effort to learn something new primarily by synthesis, instead of analysis
