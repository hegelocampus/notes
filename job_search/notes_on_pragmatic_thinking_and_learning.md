# Notes on Pragmatic Thinking and Learning
### 20-01-01
## Introduction
- Everything is connected to everything else
  - Always consider the context of what you're dealing with
## Dreyfus Model stages
### Novice
- Don't attempt to learn
- Only concerned with succeeding
- Need a recipe to follow and don't know what to do if they need to improvise
### Advanced Beginners
- Most people never leave this stage
- Don't want the big picture
- Tend to skim documentation for the meaty bits
### Competent
- Develop conceptual models of the problem domain and work with those models effectively
- Can troubleshoot on their own
- Begin to seek out and apply advice from experts
- Solve problems based on deliberate planning and past experience
  - Still have trouble determining what details to focus on
### Proficient
- Need the big picture
- Major breakthrough in being able to correct previous poor task performance
- Reflect on how they did something and revise their approach
- Can learn from others mistakes to make your approach better
- Acquired ability to **understand and apply _maxims_**
  - These are proverbial fundamental truths that can be applied to the situation at hand
- Understanding context is key to becoming an expert
### Expert
- Work from _intuition_ rather than reason
- Knows the difference between irrelevant details and the very important details, even if not at a conscious level
### Moving from Novice to expert
- The three most important changes that are made are:
  - Moving away from reliance on rules to use of intuition
  - A change in perception where you take into account context in order to focus on the relevant bits
  - A change from being a detached observer to an involved part of the system
	- You are part of the problem and you are part of the solution
