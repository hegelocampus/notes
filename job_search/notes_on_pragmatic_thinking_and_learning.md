# Notes on Pragmatic Thinking and Learning
### 20-01-01
## Introduction
- Everything is connected to everything else
  - Always consider the context of what you're dealing with
## Dreyfus Model stages
### Novice
- Don't attempt to learn
- Only concerned with succeeding
- Need a recipe to follow and don't know what to do if they need to improvise
### Advanced Beginners
- Most people never leave this stage
- Don't want the big picture
- Tend to skim documentation for the meaty bits
### Competent
- Develop conceptual models of the problem domain and work with those models effectively
- Can troubleshoot on their own
- Begin to seek out and apply advice from experts
- Solve problems based on deliberate planning and past experience
  - Still have trouble determining what details to focus on
### Proficient
- Need the big picture
- Major breakthrough in being able to correct previous poor task performance
- Reflect on how they did something and revise their approach
- Can learn from others mistakes to make your approach better
- Acquired ability to **understand and apply _maxims_**
  - These are proverbial fundamental truths that can be applied to the situation at hand
- Understanding context is key to becoming an expert
### Expert
- Work from _intuition_ rather than reason
- Knows the difference between irrelevant details and the very important details, even if not at a conscious level
### Moving from Novice to expert
- The three most important changes that are made are:
  - Moving away from reliance on rules to use of intuition
  - A change in perception where you take into account context in order to focus on the relevant bits
  - A change from being a detached observer to an involved part of the system
	- You are part of the problem and you are part of the solution
### Phases of learning:
- Imitate
  - Do as others do
  - Copy the techniques as they are taught, without modification
- Assimilate
  - Reflect on the meaning and purpose of the techniques to come to a deeper understanding of them
  - Incorporate these newly learned patterns into your tool-kit
- Innovate
  - Build new patterns/techniques yourself
### Keep practicing / Beware the Tool Trap
- A model is a tool, not a mirror
  - It shouldn't produce the exact same outcome every time you should look at how the tool fits into the context of the situation and adapt
- Rules cannot tell you the most relevant activities to perform in a given situation or the correct path to take
- **Avoid formal methods if you need creativity, intuition, or inventiveness**
  - There is no substitute for thinking
### Consider the Context, Again
- Formal knowledge is often devoid of the **truth** of context
- It is often the relationship between things that are interesting, not the things themselves. These relationships help form the context that makes all the difference.

**The most important skill to learn is the skill of learning**

### Next actions
#### Rate yourself with the Dreyfus model
##### JavaScript
- Competent
  - I think at this stage I'm really focused on just applying the methodologies that have previously succeeded for me in the past, I don't really take in a holistic account of the problem before I start to tackle it. It may help me to slow down a little and consider the context more before jumping in.
##### React
- Between Competent and Proficient
  - I like to have the big picture before I really dive into a problem, but I think I need more experience solving problems different ways before I can truly react the proficient level.
  - I believe I'm proficient in so far as I'm able to correct past mistakes that I've made when building React apps and I think I'm able to learn from others' mistakes now
  - I know I'm able to reflect on how I did something and learn to better my approach now with each try
## This Is Your Brain
### L-mode
  - synchronous
  - logical
### R-mode
  - asynchronous
  - searches through memories
  - intuition
  - Unpredictable at best
  - Be ready to capture any insight or idea twenty-four hours a day
	- Get a pen and notepad
  - nonverbal
  - Favors learning by synthesis
	- Puts together parts to form wholes
  - Likes to think of things in relation to other ideas
  - Expert level knowledge is all R-mode
	- Intuition
	- Tacit knowledge
	- Pattern recognition
**Learn by synthesis as well as by analysis**
### Attractive works better
- Contemporary life is a battle of aesthetics
- _Attractive_ user interfaces are easier to use than _unattractive_ ones
> Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love. - Louis Kahn
- You can only improve if you believe you can
### Next actions
- Make a conscious effort to learn something new primarily by synthesis, instead of analysis
## Get in your Right Mind
- Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain (i.e., fidget)
  - The more senses you involve the better
  - Things you can do:
	- Write it down
	- Draw a picture (like a metaphor)
	- Describe it verbally
	- Talk about it with people
	- Act out the roles involved
  - Your brain is built to adapt to changing environments, so change your environment regularly to feed your brain
### Engage your R-mode brain
- Often when thinking about a thing your L-mode brain responds first and gives you a simple representation of what you want, a symbol
- Oftentimes you don't want the trite symbol; you want to perceive the real thing, this takes engaging the R-mode
- Try to create a sensory experience first that you can use to contextualize L-mode logical reasoning
**Lead with R-mode; follow with L-mode**
- Start with analogic processes for connections and theories, and then use the analytic processes to validate your thinking
  - When problem solving, learn to be comfortable with uncertainty
  - When creating be comfortable with the non-sequitur and the absurd
  - When learning try to just get acquainted with the information on your first run-through
- **Use metaphor as the meeting place between L-mode and R-mode**
  - Any software system should be able to be guided by an appropriate metaphor
	- A sufficiently rich metaphor can help guide the design of a system and help answer questions that come up during development
- **Cultivate humor to build stronger metaphors**
### Harvesting with Image Streaming
- _Image Streaming_ is a technique designed to help harvest R-mode imagery
  - First, pose a problem to yourself, or ask yourself a question
  - Then close your eyes and get comfortable for about 10 minutes
  - For each image that crosses your mind, do the following:
	- Look at the image, try to see all the details you can
	- Describe it out loud, really use your voice
	- Imagine the images using all five senses
	- Use present tense, even if the image is fleeting
### Harvesting with Free-Form Journaling
- Blogging may be a good habit to get into
  - Although pen and paper is probably better because online blogging adds many technical distractions
#### Morning Pages Technique
Here's how you do it:
  - Write your morning pages _first thing_ in the morning, before coffee, before anything else
  - Write at least three pages, long hand
  - Do not censor what you write, just write whatever you're thinking
  - Do not skip a day
- This works because you're getting an unguarded brain dump
### Harvesting by Walking
- Walk a labyrinth path - A labyrinth offers only a single path - there are no decisions to be made
  - This gives your L-mode something to do while freeing up the R-mode
- When you go on your "thinking walk" don't actually do any _thinking,_ you want to let your subconscious do the work
- **Step away from the keyboard to solve hard problems**
## Debug Your Mind
- We make decisions and solve problems based on faulty memory and our emotional state at the time
There are four main categories of problems:
- _Cognitive biases_
- _Generational affinity_
- _Personality tendencies_
- _Hardware bugs_
### Cognitive biases
- There will always be elements that are just plain uncertain, _and that's not a bad thing_
- Memory isn't trustworthy **trust ink over memory; every mental read is a write**
  - You need an external tool to truth check your memory
### Generational Affinity
- Your biases are likely very common to the ones your peers have
- The biases that drive other generations are likely different than the ones that drive you and your peers
#### The Four Archetypes
- Nomad: Liberty, survival, honor
  - X-gen
- Prophet: Vision, values
  - Boomer
- Artist: Pluralism, expertise, due process
  - Silent, Homeland
- Hero: Community, affluence
  - G.I., Millennial
### Hardware Bugs
#### Lizard Logic
- Fight, flight, or fright
  - Response is to become fully aroused immediately.
  - If the situation is really bad you just freeze with fear
- Get it now
  - Everything is immediate and automatic. Don't think or plan, just follow impulses.
  - Focus on what's most exciting rather than what's most important.
- Be dominant
  - Be aggressive and stomp on others to assert your position.
  - The rules apply to everyone but you.
- Defend the territory
  - Never share info, tips, tricks, or office space.
  - If someone does something without you, cry foul and demand to know why.
- If it hurts, hiss
  - Don't bother to fix the problem, spend all your time fixing the blame on someone else instead.
- Like me == good; not like me == bad
  - Your side is always good, any other side is inherently evil.
  - Explain this to your teammates often.
**Thinking takes time; these actions and reactions work more quickly than that, and with less effort.**  
When you feel any of these try to breathe and count to 10 before you decide on a response. Let the lizard reaction pass, and allow the neocortex to process the event.
### Chapter conclusion
- **Try to lead with intuition, but follow up with provable, linear feedback - Trust Intuition, but verify.**
- Do what you need to do to prove that your idea is a good one, because your intuition may have been wrong.
#### Testing Yourself
- To get a bigger picture perspective and test your understanding and mental model, ask yourself the following:
  - How do you know?
  - Says who?
  - How specifically?
  - How does what I'm doing cause you to...?
  - Compared to what or whom?
  - Does it always happen? Can you think of an exception?
  - What would happen if you did (or didn't)?
  - What stops you from...?
  - Is there anything you can actually measure?
  - What happens when you talk this over with a colleague?
	- How about a colleague with a very different viewpoint from your own?
If you think you've defined something, try to also define its opposite.
- To avoid the blindingly rosy glow of wishful thinking, remember that every decision is a trade-off.
## Learn Deliberately
- Sheep dip learning doesn't work
  - Learning isn't done _to_ you; its something _you_ do
  - Mastering knowledge alone, without experience, is meaningless
  - A random approach, without goals and feedback, tends to give random results
- What is actually relevant to performance is:
  - The model you build in your mind
  - The questions you ask to build that model
  - Your experiences and practices that you built along the way
- A classroom experience can only get you started in the right direction
- **You need continuing goals, feedback, and intention**
### Target SMART Objectives
- To get where you want to be you need to set goals.
- But the goals need to be well defined.
- SMART objectives:
  - Specific
	- Narrow your objective down to something concrete.
  - Measurable
	- How do you know when you're done?.
	- Goes hand-in-hand with being specific.
	- Take small bites and measure steady, incremental progress.
	- You don't have to see your destination, just your next step.
  - Achievable
	- Take your personal context into account when picking your goals.
	- An unachievable goal isn't a target, its a soul-sucking frustration.
	- **Make each next objective attainable from where you are _now_**
  - Relevant
	- It needs to _matter_ and be something that you have control over.
  - Time-boxed
	- You need to give yourself a deadline.
	- Without deadlines, a goal will languish and be perpetually pushed aside by the more pressing exigencies of the day.
	- Give yourself small and frequent milestones so that you'll be more motivated to meet them.
### Objective in a Larger Context
- Goals need to make sense in context
- Consider the impact your goals will have within a wider context
Three most important goals for me:
- Get a Software Engineering job at Google
  - Get through all LeetCode Google prep material by the end of January
  - Read first 100 pages of Algorithm Design Manual by the end of January
  - Find a mentor at Google to help me learn
- Translate Acorn.js to Dart
  - Write basic tests by 20-01-20
  - Adapt Acorn `index.js` to `main.dart` by 20-01-25
- Learn Flutter
  - Setup environment by 20-01-20
  - Make basic to-do app by the end of January
### Create a Pragmatic Investment Plan
- Have a concrete plan
  - Devise levels of goals over time, e.g., now, next year, five years from now
  - Planning is far more important than the plan
- Diversify
  - Make a conscious effort to diversify your attention
  - Take into account the return on your investment for your learning. Skills everyone has will be less impressive than more unique skills, but unique skills have a greater risk
- Make an active investment
  - Deliberately stop and reevaluate your portfolio of skills and what you can do to better yourself
- Make a regular investment
  - Make sure you regularly try to learn a particular skill, you may not always have a productive learning session but in the long term your irregularities will smooth out and you will learn if you set yourself up to.
  - Make a commitment to invest a minimum amount of time on a regular basis
### Use your primary leaning mode
General Types:
  - Visual learners: need to see the material *I'm pretty sure I'm a visual learner
  - Auditory learners: have to hear the material.
  - Kinesthetic learner: learn my moving and touching *With perhaps some kinesthetic tendencies
- These differences aren't necessarily cast in stone, you may be able to change the effectiveness of different types of learning.
- Characteristics of an adult learner:
  - Motivated to learn if learning will serve their interests & needs.
  - Units studied should be real-life situations.
  - Analysis of the learner's experience is the core method employed.
  - Need self-direction.
  - Instructors must allow for differences in style, time, place, and pace.
### Work Together, Study Together
- Study groups are great.
- A reading group is a great place to start.
### Use Enhanced Learning Techniques
#### Read Deliberately with SQ3R
Process:
  - Survey: Scan the table of contents and chapter summaries for an overview.
  - Question: Note any questions you have.
  - Read: Read it in its entirety.
  - Recite: Summarize, take notes, and put in your own words.
  - Review: Reread, expand notes, and discuss with colleagues.
- Survey:
  - Look over all the hight-level landmarks left by the author.
  - Get a good overview of the book without diving in to detail.
- Question:
  - Write down any questions you want answered.
	- How does this tech solve this problem?
	- Will I learn how to do this one thing?
  - Rephrase the chapter and section heads as questions.
- Read:
  - Actually read the book.
  - Carry it with you so you can read in any spare time: While waiting for an appointment or on the bus or whenever.
  - Slow down on the difficult parts and reread sections as needed.
- Recite:
  - As you go through the book recite recall and rephrase (in your own words) the most important bits.
  - Try to synthesize the information; draw connections to other things you know and make analogies to other things.
  - Organic mind-maps of the material are very useful.
- Review:
  - Reread portions as needed and expand your notes as you start to synthesize what you read
#### Mind maps:
- Take advantage of the way your eye scans and reads a piece of paper.
- Spatial cuing conveys information in a way that linear words can't.
- Once you've completed your mental map re-create it on a fresh piece of paper.
- Nonspecific, non-goal-oriented "playing" with information is a great  way to gain insights and see hidden relationships.
- Graphic enhancements are not random, they help coax additional thinking and meaning from you.
- Most effective when you're not exactly sure what you'll find

- If documentation doesn't provide value, don't do it: **writing documentation for documentation's sake is a waste of time**
- This sort of documentation generally has no audience
- Use a pragmatic filter to make sure the investment in creating any documentation is really worth the effort.
- **Documenting is more important that documentation**
### Learn By Teaching
- Describe the problem to a co-worker
  - Explain it to a rubber duck
- Explain the problem/subject to someone outside of your area of expertise
- **See it. Do it. Teach it.**
## Gain Experience
- Questions:
  - How do you gain experience effectively?
  - What kind of experience helps you learn?
  - How can playing help me learn more effectively?
  - Does an expert gain experience any differently than a beginner?
### Notes
- Trying too hard can be just as bad (if not worse) than slogging though the same old motions
- How to gain experience effectively:
  - Build to learn, not learn to build.
  - Fail efficiently with better feedback.
  - Groove your neural pathways for success.
#### Play in Order to Learn
- Exploring or "playing with," the material should come before studying facts.
- _Constructivism:_ We build to learn, not learn to build
  - Real learning comes from experience and cognition
- Structure learning such that you can build on top of existing experience
- Effective play is challenging enough to maintain interest and progress at solving the problem domain
- Flash cards are one way to "gamify" the material
- The idea is to engage as much of your being in the learning process as possible:
  - Verbal
  - Visual
  - Musical
  - Numerical
  - Gross-motor body movement
  - Fine-motor finger movement
  - And so on
#### Leverage Existing Knowledge
- When engaging a problem:
  - Ask yourself these questions:
	- What are the unknown aspects?
	- What _do_ you know? What data do you have?
	- What constraints and what rules apply?
  - Then make a plan, execute it, and review the results:
	- Break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.
	- Compare this problem to a similar problem you have faced before.
	- Draw a picture of the problem.
	- Solve a similar problem and then try to solve this problem again; drop some of the constraints or use just a subset of the data.
	- Try restating the problem.
	- Try working backwards from the unknown towards the data.
- There is a downside to looking for similarities:
  - Be careful not to get stuck in the trap of only ever performing the new thing in the same way you would do the old thing.
  - You need to unlearn just as much as you need to learn.
  - **Learn from similarities; unlearn from differences**
  - Another danger is that the problem you thought was similar may be completely wrong
#### Embed Failing in Practice
- Debugging is a part of life -- not just software.
- "Errors benefit us because they lead us to study what happened, to understand what went wrong, and, through understanding, to fix it." - Papert
- Failure is critical to success
  - But the failure cannot be random, it must be well-managed failure. These are created from a good learning environment where feedback and retroflection are encouraged
- Not all mistakes are things you do; some are things you didn't do but should have.
  - "I don't know" is a fine answer, but don't let it end there. Be curious and look up things you bump into that you don't know about
- It's not important to get it right the first time; **it's important to get it right the last time.**
- In order to learn you need the following:
  - To be able to explore unfamiliar territory relatively free from risk. Don't hold yourself back from trying something new.
  - You need to be able to explore even if you don't know where you're going.
  - You need to be free to invert, be comfortable with the things you create not working out.
  - You need to be able to apply what you've learned in your day-to-day practice.
- **Explore, invent, and apply in your environment -- safely**
##### How to create an exploratory environment
- You need the following:
  - Freedom to experiment
	- Few problems have a single, best solution.
	- When you have multiple possible solutions, try to at least prototype each way.
	- Make sure the experimentation doesn't adversely affect anyone else on the team.
  - Ability to backtrack to a stable state
	- **Use source control**
  - Reproduce any work product as of any time
	- Just going back to a previous version of the source code isn't quite enough, you need to actually be able to run the code.
	- Can you run a version of the program from last year or last month?
  - Ability to demonstrate progress
	- You can't get anywhere without feedback.
	- Did your experiment work better than the alternatives? How do you know?
	- Is the project progressing?
	- You need to be able to demonstrate fine-grained progress to yourself as well as to others.
- This is all pretty simple to do in software development, its just the **Starter Kit:**
  - Version Control:
	- Stores every version of every file you work with.
	- Git is great for helping you experiment.
  - Unit testing:
	- Provides a fine-grained set of regression tests. You can use the results of these tests to compare alternatives.
	- These allow you to have a solid indication of progress.
  - Project automation:
	- Ties it all together and ensures that the trivial mechanics are taken care of in a reliable, repeatable manner.
- The Starter Kit gives you the advantage of freedom to experiment, with comparatively little risk.
